<p class="message">
I just graduated with a PhD in Statistics at the University of Chicago! I've also become involved with the Chicago Data Science community through the <a href="http://dssg.io" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good</a>.
</p>

I've accepted a position as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan in the Statistical Reinforcement Lab!  I will be moving to Ann Arbor in July and beginning to work on statistical and machine learning methods in connection with mHealth.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS with Honors in Mathematics, BS Economics, and BA Statistics (2009).  I'm from the great state of New Jersey.

I have several collaborators, with whom I work closely:

* [Peter McCullagh](http://galton.uchicago.edu/~pmcc/)
* [Harry Crane](http://stat.rutgers.edu/home/hcrane/)
* [Risi Kondor](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~risi/)
* [Susan Murphy](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~samurphy/)
* [Ambuj Tewari](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~tewaria/)

Interested in similar topics? Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/plusthemonk.github.io/issues/new) or email me(<dempsey.walter@gmail.com>).

Thanks for reading!
